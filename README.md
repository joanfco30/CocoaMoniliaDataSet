# CocoaMoniliaDataSet
**CocoaMoniliaDataset v1** is an annotated RGB image dataset created to support a computer vision task for the detection of *MoniMoniliophthora roreri* in cocoa pods. **CocoaMoniliaDataset v1** involved the labeling of four classes: (1) Healthy cocoa pods labeled as **h0**, (2) Firt cycle of Monilia (Humps) labeled as **m1**, (3) It is a combination of the second and third cycle of the disease (Brown and oily spots) labeled as **m2**, and (4) Fourth cycle of Monilia (Sporulation) labeled as **m3**. The annotation formats are provided in **COCO 1.0**, **YOLO**, and **Segmentation Maks 1.1**.
